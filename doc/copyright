License:

	I intend to release this package under an opensource license but have not yet chosen one. If you are interested in
	using this package for commercial use please contact me.

	This package is proprietary software. This license grants limited use of this particular software version.

	Definition of 'use of this particular software version'. This phrase includes installing the project from debian or rpm
	packages to invoke the components installed be the package. It also includes cloning the source project to invoke components
	from the source folders. Modifications of the source may be made. The source, with or without modifications can not be published.
	It is not allowed to remove parts of the software to be used outside the context of this project.

	I grant use of this particular software version under the following conditions.
		1) Personal use. Personal use is allowed. Examples of personal use include a personal website, a home network, or
		   simulations of commercial activities which do not actually conduct commercial activities. A commercial activity is defined
		   as any that is designed to sell products. Marketing oneself in order to obtain employment is considered personal use.
		2) Commercial use. Commercial use is defined as any that does not qualify as personal use as defined above. Commercial use
		   is allowed on any non-production equipment even if that equipment supports commercial activities. Non-production devices
		   are any that would not impact commercial activities if they were to be turned off. The intent is to allow prototyping and
		   proof of concept projects and also internal projects used within an organization by commercial entities. Furthermore, the
		   software can be used on a production equipment for up to one year. The intent of this provision is to provide leeway
		   for commercial use that is not deliberate and long lived.
