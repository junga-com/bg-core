Description: Configuration management and sysadmin tools for linux hosts
 bg-core provides an environment maintaining the configuration of linux servers
 and workstations. It introduces a notion of plugins that can be delivered in
 packages to extend other packages in a controlled way. Config plugins provide
 units of configuration that can be delivered in packages and then turned on
 and off by the host admin. Standards plugins along with Config plugins provide
 ongoing configuration monitoring to report on compliance with policies set by
 the controlling domain.
 bg-core also provides a rich bash programming environment that handles many of
 rote tasks required to write robust system administration scripts.
 See man(7) bg-core after installing.
