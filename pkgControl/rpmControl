%description
bg-core provides an environment maintaining the configuration of linux servers
and workstations. It introduces a notion of plugins that can be delivered in
packages to extend other packages in a controlled way. Config plugins provide
units of configuration that can be delivered in packages and then turned on
and off by the host admin. Standards plugins along with Config plugins provide
ongoing configuration monitoring to report on compliance with policies set by
the controlling domain.
bg-core also provides a rich bash programming environment that handles many of
rote tasks required to write robust system administration scripts.
See man(7) bg-core after installing.
