# note that the terminology of these format fields is that of a table with rows and columns but more generally rows are records
# and columns are fields. A result set is traversed for output by row/record and then by column/field. This allows either a
# traditional table type format or a vertical, list of record type format (similar to mysql client's \G terminator).

# Whether column/field labels are included in the output is controlled by at runtime (typically the -H option).
# If labels/header data is included in the output colLabelType format attribute will determine if the labels appear as the first
# record (colLabelType==header) or at each data cell as a field label (colLabelType==inline). The value colLabelType==none will
# suppress labels even if the runtime options call for it.
#    colLabelType=header  : first table row is a header with column names
#    colLabelType=inline  : no header. each cell is <colName>:<data>
#    colLabelType=none    : no labels. Note that typically the format is 'header' and the -H option controls whether the header is printed
colLabelType = header

# The location of where headerCells are output depend on colLabelType but in any case its always a cell whose value in the column name
headerCellPre = %csiFaint%%csiReverse%
headerCellPost= %csiNorm%

# when colLabelType==header these are applied to the first row of the table that contain the column names
headerRowPre   = ""
headerRowPost  = "\n"

# these are the data cells that appear in each row
cellPre = ""
cellPost= ""
cellSep = " "

# these are the rows of the table.

rowPost  = "\n"
